Some information about you!


### Hi! I'm Camilo, and welcome to my blog! 

## Who are you??
My name is Camilo and I am currently an Economics and Computer Science Major and a student in Joanna Klukowska's Open Source Software Development class.

When I'm not coding or contributing to open source projects I spend my free time learning new recipies or catching up on my video game backlog.
